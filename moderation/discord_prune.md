# Discord Prune

Discord Prune Article: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/213507137-How-to-Prune

Pruning is a Discord feature that allows server admins to remove inactive or stale accounts from the server. It will kick users that have not been logged into Discord for either 7 or 30 days. By default, pruning targets users **WITHOUT** any roles assigned (only the default everyone role). 

> In servers that set up a "default everyone jail" that only contains the users with no roles that did not complete the onboarding process, this will work well to run at scheduled times. 

Using the **Also Include Members with These Roles** section in the pruning pop-up window, admins can also target users in specific roles (along with the default everyone users) that have also not been active on Discord for either 7 or 30 days.
